## What is this about?

I simulated random walks and concluded that diffusive properties arise from them.

## How good is it?

It's a very basic 2D random walk algorithm. I spent like 30 minutes doing it. It does what you ask it to do. It can use polar coordinates as well, so that is neat. Probably will work on improving performance/shipping it to programming languages that are not trash eventually. Or not. Who knows. I'll do it next year.

## Can I test it out?

Sure, hope you like it! Do make adjustments and let me know about them!

## Do you like me?
